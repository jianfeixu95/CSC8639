Small nodular opacities are seen in the aerated portion of the right lung, potentially vessels on end. The left lung is clear. There is no left-sided effusion. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Old bilateral rib fractures are identified. An endotracheal tube is seen ending approximately 4 cm above the carina. An esophageal tube ends beyond the gastroesophageal junction with the tip out of view. Artifact from external monitoring and supporting devices is present.
